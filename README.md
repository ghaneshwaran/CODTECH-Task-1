OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Shopping_Trends Dataset
1. Project Overview
Objective: Perform EDA on shopping trends to understand consumer behavior, identify key sales drivers, and optimize business strategies.
Dataset: Use a shopping dataset (e.g., sales data, customer demographics, product details) from platforms like Kaggle or scrape e-commerce websites (with permission).
Outcome: Insights into sales patterns, customer preferences, and actionable recommendations for business growth.
2. Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python
Libraries:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Visualization Tools: IDLE
Optional: Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis.
3. Project Steps
Step 1: Problem Definition
Understand the key questions:
Which product categories have the highest sales?
How do discounts and promotions affect customer purchases?
What are the seasonal trends in shopping behavior?
Step 2: Data Collection
Collect data from:
Open datasets from kaggle
Business records (sales logs, transaction data).
Web scraping for product reviews or pricing trends (if applicable).
Step 3: Data Cleaning
Handle missing values:
Replace missing sales figures with mean/median or interpolate values.
Remove or treat outliers using statistical methods (e.g., IQR, Z-score).
Standardize data formats (e.g., consistent date-time format).
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate Analysis:
Distribution of sales, prices, and quantities.
Visualize with histograms, bar charts, or pie charts.
Bivariate Analysis:
Correlation between sales and discounts.
Relationship between customer age and purchasing behavior.
Multivariate Analysis:
Combine product, region, and sales data to detect patterns.
Use pair plots and clustering techniques for deeper insights.
Step 5: Time Series Analysis
Study trends in sales over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Decompose time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
Step 6: Customer Segmentation
Perform RFM Analysis:
Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
Monetary: How much a customer spends.
Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group similar customers.
Step 7: Visualization
Create interactive dashboards with:
Sales by region, product, and category.
Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
Line charts for sales trends.
Step 8: Insights and Recommendations
Summarize findings:
Seasonal spikes (e.g., holiday sales).
High-demand product categories.
Customer preferences and price sensitivity.
Provide actionable recommendations:
Optimize inventory for high-demand seasons.
Tailor marketing campaigns to target segments.
4. Deliverables
Codebase: A well-documented script or notebook.
Visualization: Interactive dashboard or static visualizations.
Report: A detailed summary of findings, insights, and recommendations.
5. Potential Extensions
Predictive Analysis: Use machine learning to forecast future sales.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer reviews to assess product satisfaction.
Recommendation Systems: Suggest products to customers based on past behavior.
